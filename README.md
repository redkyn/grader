[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/grade-it/grader.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/grade-it/grader)

This program uses Docker and Python to easily grade many assignments in an encapsulated, safe manner. The general process starts by creating an image for a class or an assignment. That image can be given a payload, a protected grading script, which has a grading hooks. The grade module, when ran, creates an individual container for each student's assignment and runs a payload hook. The payload then returns a JSON response with stdin, stdout, and additional response information depending on the image ran.

## Setup

This project is setup using [buildout](http://www.buildout.org/en/latest/). It's super easy to get `grader` up and running:

You'll probably need the following libraries...

* build-essential
* libncurses-dev
* python3-dev

And, of course, you'll want Docker if you plan to do anything interesting at all. Grader requires docker with **API version >= 1.20**. We use `put_archive` (`PUT /containers/(id)/archive`) from docker-py.

```shell
# Bootstrap buildout
python3 bin/bootstrap-buildout.py

# Setup your development environment with buildout
bin/buildout
```

Now you're done! When it sets up your environment, buildout creates a couple of executables and places them in `bin/` for you. They are:

* **buildout** : That's buildout. Run it whenever you add eggs to `grader/setup.py` or modify `buildout.cfg`
* **grader** : That's `grader`!
* **python** : "What? Another Python!?" Yeah... This is an ipython interpreter. It's handy because it has access to all the same packages that were installed for `grader`.

## Check your style

It's important to keep our code looking consistent. There's a tool installed by buildout called `flake8` that will check your Python source for issues in style. Simply run it like this:

```shell
# Make sure you run this in your grader directory. flake8 will recursively check source files for style issues.
bin/flake8 grader/
```
